# allworks
All works of George Eliot, .txt and .xml editions, by the George Eliot Archive team. The first open-source, open-access, machine-readable complete works of George Eliot was completed in 2023 (after years of dirty OCR) by the George Eliot Archive, GeorgeEliotArchive.org, edited by Beverley Park Rilett.  We are happy to share the database we created. Attribute our project if you reuse our work. License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
