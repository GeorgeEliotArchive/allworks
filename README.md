# allworks
All works of George Eliot, .txt and .xml editions, by the George Eliot Archive team, primarily by Yue Cui at Auburn University. 
After years of cleaning dirty OCR, the first open-source, open-access, machine-readable complete works of George Eliot was completed in 2023 by the George Eliot Archive, GeorgeEliotArchive.org, edited by Beverley Park Rilett.  We are happy to share the database we created. Attribute our project if you reuse our work. License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
